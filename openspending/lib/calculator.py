# Row 1 is average gross income per decile - including benefits, pensions etc
# Row 2 is average direct taxation - income tax, employee NI and council tax
# Row 3 is average total indirect taxation MINUS VAT, tobacco, alcohol,
# & car costs
# Row 4 is average total VAT paid
# Row 5 is average total tobacco tax paid
